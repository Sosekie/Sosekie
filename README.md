### Hi, I'm Chenrui Fan👋

🌱 I'm studying for a master's degree in computer science at the University of Bern, Switzerland.

⚡ My area of interest is deep learning, especially computer vision and multimodel. But I do not want to limit the scope of my research, whatever research that interests me or bring me happy is nice for me.

🔭 Research I'm currently working on:

- Diffusion-Model-Based Time-Series Super-Resolution.
- Generated-Model-Based Federated Learning.

⛄️ I have the following project experience:

- Vue-based web program development (Second prize of C4 - 2022 Network Technology Challenge).
- WeChat program development (First prize of C4 - 2022 WeChat Application Development Challenge).
- Contrast learning based automatic video scoring.
- Text extraction and matching algorithm in hand-writing documents.
- Document Layout Analysis.
- Efficient Cherry-pick Retrieval.
- Multimodal User Interface.
